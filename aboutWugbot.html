<h2>Mission Statement</h2>

<p>We aim to build tools, documentation, and example applications to help the field of linguistics reap more benefits from digitization. We have chosen the web platform as a suitable platform for this work.</p>

<p>We have chosen the web platform for a variety of reasons:
</p>

<ul>
<li>No one needs to <em>install</em> or <em>download</em> anything! Anyone with internet access typically has a browser already available on their device.</li>
<li>The web platform comes with a markup language for <em>organizing data</em> (HTML), an independent markup language for adding <em>styles like colors and fonts</em> (CSS), and a scripting language for <em>manipulating data</em> (JavaScript). </li>
<li>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are relatively <em>easy to learn</em> and work together seemlessly <em>across platforms</em>. This means you can make it on Windows, Mac, or Linux and it will work on Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox, or any other browser.</li>
<li>
</ul>
