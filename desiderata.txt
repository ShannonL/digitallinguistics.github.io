Desiderata:
- Popups appear in fixed position
- Prompt to select all if user already has some items selected
- Delete tags via right click (both overview and details view)
- Clicking on tag category renders all tags with that category (not just exact matches)
- Count of the number of items with each tag (overview view)
- Character palette
- Notes field on the tag
- Color field on tag
- Ability to rename tags (combine add and delete process)
- Ability to view multiple tag sets at once (maybe with ctrl + click; if ctrl is down, display both)
- Clicking the manage corpora box, then clicking outside of it, seems to reset the workview - stop this behavior
- Hide the results counter when the tagger module is hidden (it displays the last result when the user comes back to it)
- Ability to search for things that *don't* have a particular tag
- Ability to search within results
- Tagger results should not be contentEditable
- Edit tags in place
- Tags overview list still isn't sorting correctly (you should just filter the tags into new arrays, and display only those arrays) in order
